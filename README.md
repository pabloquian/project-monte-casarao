# MONTE DO CASARAO PROJECT

### This is my Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp final project, a Data Analytics project about the cottage renting company Monte do Casarao.


Inside the `Notebooks` folder you will find two Jupyter Notebooks, where is the work I have done using Pyhton.

In the first notebook I perform the following tasks:
* Load datasets from the `Hoofddatabestand_2008_2023.xlsx` file.
* Clean datasets (`cleaned_dataframes` folder).
* Save dataframes with errors to show the client (`errors_to_report_client` folder).
* Save cleaned dataframes as csv.


In the second notebook I perform the following tasks:
* Data Transforming (merge the datasets to easily work in Tableau).
* Exploratory Data Analysis.
* Web Scrape SEO information about their website (`seo_info_scraped` folder).


I also built a relational database in Access and a Power BI report that is linked to this database. The idea is that the client fills the database with new information, and the Power BI report can be refreshed updating the Power BI report with the new appended data. This is not ideal as there are options to avoid the client having to enter new information into the database by himself, but he insisted that this was not a problem for him. You can find the files inside the `report_and_db` folder.

Finally, I created visualisations using Tableau to make a PowerPoint presentation and show the project in front of my bootcamp peers and the client. You can find the presentation in ppt and pdf format inside the `presentation_ppt` folder.
