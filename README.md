# MONTE DO CASARAO PROJECT

This is a Data Analytics project about the company Monte do Casarao. The main objective is to give the client valuable insights about the business.

I created unique client ids to build a relation between tables and transformed the data in Excel to be able to work in Python. Then in Python I cleaned the datasets and reported strange observations to the client. 
In addition, I made a simple linear regression model to predict revenue for the next 2 years and I built a piece of code to scrape SEO information from the business web page. Lastly I made plots in Tableu to satisfy the client's request and give meaningful insights about the business.
